# 💰 Cashflow - Expense Sharing Application
Cashflow is a C++ console-based application inspired by Splitwise that simplifies group expense management. It helps users track and split expenses fairly among a group of people, ensuring transparency and accountability in shared financial situations.


# 🌟 Features
• Add Members: Add individuals to the group for whom expenses need to be tracked.<br>
• Log Expenses: Record expenses with details like the amount, payer, and participants.<br>
• Split Expenses: Automatically calculate and display how much each person owes or is owed.<br>
• Transaction Simplification: Optimizes payments by minimizing the number of transactions required to settle balances.<br>
• User-Friendly Interface: Intuitive command-line prompts and menus make it easy to navigate.<br>


# 🛠️ Technologies Used
1. Programming Language:<br>
C++: The application is implemented in C++ using object-oriented programming principles for modular and efficient code design.
2. Data Structures:<br>
Vectors: For managing expense records and participants.
3. Algorithms:<br>
Greedy Approach: Used to simplify transactions and minimize the number of payments required to settle balances.


# 📖 How It Works
Add Members:<br>
Users can add participants (e.g., friends, family members, colleagues) to the group.<br>

Log an Expense:<br>
Enter details of an expense, including the amount, payer, and participants involved. The application splits the expense equally among the participants.

View Balances:<br>
Displays how much each member owes or is owed. Balances are updated dynamically as expenses are logged.

Simplify Transactions:<br>
Minimizes the number of payments by consolidating debts between members.<br>


# 🙌 Future Enhancements
Add a GUI for a more interactive user experience.<br>
Include support for percentage-based splits.<br>
Implement data persistence to save and reload expense data.<br>
